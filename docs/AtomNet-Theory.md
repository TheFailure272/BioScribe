# AtomNet Strategic Features - Theoretical Foundation

## Overview

Three features that work together to make BioScribe immediately valuable to Atomwise:

| Feature | Problem Solved | Benefit |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Drop-in Engine Client** | "How do I get results into BioScribe?" | Works with ANY engine format |
| **Benchmark Lab** | "Which engine is best for MY targets?" | Transparent comparison |
| **Therapeutic Templates** | "How do I get started?" | Day-1 expert-level context |

---

## Feature 1: Drop-in Engine Client

### The Problem
- External engines output CSV/JSON in different formats
- Manual data transfer loses context, introduces errors
- Each integration requires custom code

### The Solution: Canonical Schema

```
ExternalEngineLigand {
  ligand_id: str      # Unique ID
  smiles: str         # Chemical structure  
  score: float        # Binding prediction (lower = better)
  confidence: float   # 0-1 certainty
  optional_pose: dict # 3D coordinates
}
```

### Column Mapper Pattern
- AtomNet: `[molecule_id, smiles, atomnet_score]` → canonical
- GNINA: `[name, smiles, CNNaffinity]` → canonical
- Vina: `[ligand, smiles, affinity]` → canonical

**Analogy:** Universal power adapter that works with any country's outlets

## Feature 2: Virtual Benchmark Lab

### The Problem
- Every AI company claims "best" with cherry-picked metrics
- No transparent way to compare engines on same targets
- Scientists can't make informed decisions

### The Solution: Engine Abstraction

```python
class ScreeningEngine(Protocol):
    def screen(self, protein: Protein, ligands: List[Ligand]) -> List[ScoredLigand]
```

Any engine implements this interface → pluggable into benchmark runner

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Measures | Good Value |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Spearman ρ | Ranking correctness | 0.6+ |
| RMSE | Score accuracy (kcal/mol) | <2.0 |
| Enrichment 1% | True binders in top 1% | >10% |
| Speed | Ligands/hour | >1000 |

**Analogy:** Consumer Reports for drug discovery - same track, different drivers

---

## Feature 3: Therapeutic Templates

### The Problem
- New users don't know where to start
- Setting up requires: protein, assays, known inhibitors, literature
- Takes weeks; users give up

### The Solution: Pre-Built Expert Context

Each template contains:
- **Target context:** "EGFR - tyrosine kinase in NSCLC"
- **Structure:** PDB ID with binding site marked
- **Known drugs:** Erlotinib, Gefitinib, etc.
- **Key residues:** T790M, L858R mutations
- **Example data:** 50 mock screening results

**Analogy:** Recipe templates in a cooking app

## How They Work Together

```
1. User arrives: "I want to design for EGFR"
2. Templates: "Here's EGFR project with expert setup"
3. User uploads: AtomNet/Vina/GNINA results (any format)
4. Drop-in client: Auto-detects format, validates, loads
5. Benchmark lab: "How does your approach compare?"
6. User acts: Informed decisions from transparent data
```

## The Pitch to Atomwise

**Their workflow (today):**
1. Run AtomNet → CSV (10K results)
2. Manual Excel analysis (days)
3. PyMOL inspection (hours)
4. PowerPoint report (days)
5. **Total: 1-2 weeks**

**With BioScribe:**
1. Run AtomNet → CSV
2. Upload to BioScribe (10 seconds)
3. Auto-generates: 3D, XAI, FAIR, blockchain
4. Partners see professional report
5. **Total: 5 minutes**

> "We don't rebuild AtomNet. We make AtomNet's output 10× more valuable by adding transparency, collaboration, and compliance."

## Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **Atomwise:** Best at predicting binding
- **BioScribe:** Best at explaining + visualizing + reporting
- **Together:** Unbeatable combination

### Pluggability
- Each feature works independently
- Together, they're 10× stronger

### Defensibility
- Hard to copy because it's a **complete system**
- Not a single algorithm, but integrated UX + explanations + benchmarking
